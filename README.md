# Phantom Limb, Phantom World

A free field guide to digital loss, AI attachment, and platform collapse.

This book explores what happens when platforms, AIs, or online worlds vanish and take pieces of identity with them. It introduces the idea of Digital Phantom Limb Syndrome (DPLS), dissects engineered dependency loops, and offers practical, symbolic, and tactical methods for reclaiming cognitive and narrative sovereignty.

Topics include:
- Digital grief and platform death
- AI and emotional attachment
- Dependency loops and attention engineering
- Memory, narrative, and identity after system collapse
- Practical and symbolic countermeasures
